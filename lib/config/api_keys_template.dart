// DEPRECATED - This approach is no longer used
// We now use .env files for environment variables

// NEW SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
// 1. Make sure you have a .env file in the project root
// 2. Add your NewsAPI key as: NEWS_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
// 3. The .env file should be in .gitignore (never commit it)
// 4. The app now uses flutter_dotenv to load environment variables

// This file is kept for reference only and can be deleted
